Hey {{ recipient_name }},

You did it! Your event {{ event_title }} was marked 'successful',
which means you successfully completed your event. That calls for a celebration.

Why not post something on the activity page to update everyone who participated,
so you can celebrate together. Make sure the email notification is turned on, so all attendees
will be notified of the update.
